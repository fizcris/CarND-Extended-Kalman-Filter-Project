# Extended Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

The goal of the project is the use of a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see the uWebSocketIO Starter Guide page in the classroom within the EKF Project lesson for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF


In main.cpp is the main protocol that the file uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


**INPUT**: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


**OUTPUT**: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x

["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y

["rmse_x"]

["rmse_y"]

["rmse_vx"]

["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF `

## Code Style

Based on [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Generating Additional Data

Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for


## Hints and Tips and other stuff!

 * Please note that the ```Eigen``` library does not initialize ```VectorXd``` or ```MatrixXd``` objects with zeros upon creation.
 * Would it be possible to compute RMSE more eficciently rather thna a for loop.
 * Measurements are discarder if they make the denominator nil, so in those steps only the prediction is computed.

 
 ## Effects from radar and Lidar

* When turning Radar off
  * Speed predcitions get more innacurate

* When turning Lidar off
  * I guess not much as the covariances in position are quite similar for both sensors

* Note that there is a bug that makes the code get stuck in `h.run()` when the update part of the EKF is turned off (even with only one of them radar/lidar). I believe the simulator stops sending back data for some reaso.
